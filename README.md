# Predicting Daily Shortfall Of Electricity Generated In Spain 

## Project Description

In this project, we built a regression model to predict the three-hourly load shortfall in Spain precisely. (Load shortfall in this case refers to the difference between renewable and non-renewable energy generation).The Spanish Government is considering further investments in renewable energy. To do so, they need information about Spain's current renewable and non-renewable energy generation trends and patterns. Specifically, they want to be able to predict the load shortfall on any given day given certain conditions (wind speed, pressure, humidity etc.).

## Feature

We used a regression model to make predictions on the dataset, the model was deployed using flask on an EC2 instance for easy access to non technical stakeholders.

## Tools used

* Python
* Flask
* Sklearn
* AWS EC2
* GitHub


## Installation

1. pip install ipython (preferably Python 3.10.11)
2. Install the project dependencies including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn using the following command: <br> 
pip install -U matplotlib numpy pandas scikit-learn <br> 

## Result 

We were able to visualize the three hourly shortfall by days of the week from the dataset as seen in the graph below:

</p>

We used a regression model to make predictions using different models and RSME score and the R-squared score as an evaluation metrics, the random forest model performmed better and was used to make the final prediction of the given dataset. The model was deployed using flask on an EC2 instance. <br> 


## Conclusion

Through our iterative evaluation and testing of our model, we were able to find a better model to predict the 3 hourly load shortfalls of power generated by renewable sources in Spain and make recommendations on the best renewable energy resources for them to invest in. <br>
